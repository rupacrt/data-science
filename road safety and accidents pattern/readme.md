BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT

In India, road accidents present severe challenges, including high injury and fatality rates, substantial economic losses, and profound emotional trauma for victims and their families. Contributing factors such as poor road conditions, high traffic volumes, adverse weather conditions, and unsafe driving behaviors exacerbate these issues. By leveraging Qlik's advanced data analytics platform, we can comprehensively analyze traffic data, accident reports, weather patterns, road infrastructure, and demographic information. This thorough analysis will enable the identification of accident hotspots, trends, and underlying causes. Consequently, our insights can drive targeted interventions, such as optimized traffic management, enhanced road infrastructure, strategic safety campaigns, and policy reforms. Ultimately, this data-driven approach aims to significantly reduce accidents, save lives, and improve road safety for all.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

The business requirements for utilizing Qlik's data analytics platform to analyze road safety and accident patterns in India include integrating diverse data sources such as traffic data, accident reports, weather conditions, road infrastructure details, and demographic information. The project aims to identify high-frequency accident hotspots, analyze historical trends to uncover recurring factors, and develop predictive models to forecast potential accident scenarios. This will involve creating detailed visualizations, correlation analyses, and predictive analytics. The insights will help stakeholders, including government authorities, transportation agencies, and road safety organizations, to make data-driven decisions. These decisions could involve implementing targeted interventions like improved traffic monitoring, enhanced signage, speed limit adjustments, and preemptive safety measures, ultimately aiming to reduce accidents and improve road safety.

LITERATURE SURVEY

A literature survey for analyzing road safety and accident patterns involves a comprehensive review of existing research, studies, reports, and statistical data on this topic. This survey aims to understand the various methodologies and techniques used in analyzing accident data, while also summarizing the key findings and conclusions from these studies. To gather relevant information, it is beneficial to explore academic databases such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, alongside institutional repositories. Government reports and publications also provide critical insights into recent advancements and trends in road safety. By conducting this thorough review, the literature survey will identify gaps in current research and guide the development of effective, data-driven strategies to enhance road safety.

SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS
